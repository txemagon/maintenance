# Executes host after host several processes.

# Usage:   ./remote_install <command_file>
# Example: ./remote_install maneuvers/editor

# The example above forces you to use the install version 
# since it needs to be feeded with user input for config options.

# Note: Point with userhost.lst (symbolic link) to a file
# containing the hosts.

for ip in `cat userhost.lst`; do
    toilet -f term -F border --gay $ip
